const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.post('/api/form-data', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body;
  // Save the form data to your database here
  res.send('Data sent successfully');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});


we can use Postman to send a POST request to this endpoint with the form data. Here's an example code for that:

Open Postman and create a new request
Set the request method to POST
Set the request URL to http://localhost:3000/api/form-data (replace with your own endpoint URL)
Go to the "Body" tab and select "x-www-form-urlencoded" as the request body type
Add the form data to the request body, for example:
name=John Doe
email=acehackuser1@example.com
message=Hello hackers!




RESTful API endpoint on Node.js and Express that will accept POST requests with form data:

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/api/form-data', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body;
  
  // Do something with the form data here
  // For example, you can save it to your database
  
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'success',
    message: 'Form data has been submitted successfully!'
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
Here's a brief explanation of what this code does:

you import the required modules, including express and body-parser.
you create an instance of the Express application and set the port to 3000.
you configure the body-parser middleware to parse incoming request bodies in URL-encoded and JSON formats.
you create a POST route for the /api/form-data endpoint.
Inside the route handler function, we extract the form data from the request body using destructuring.
you can then perform any necessary actions with the form data, such as saving it to a database.
Finally, we send a JSON response indicating that the form data has been submitted successfully.
our team can customize this code to fit your specific needs, such as adding validation and error handling for the form data.



API debug request solver 

also code for debugging the api request


const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const debug = require('debug')('app');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/api/form-data', (req, res) => {
  debug('Received form data:', req.body);
  
  // Do something with the form data here
  // For example, you can save it to your database
  
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'success',
    message: 'Form data has been submitted successfully!'
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  debug(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});


WHAT CODE DOES

in ace hack we didnt got time to setup everything but to demonstrate mechanism we are writing shortly

We import the required modules, including express, body-parser, and debug.
We create an instance of the Express application and set the port to 3000.
We configure the body-parser middleware to parse incoming request bodies in URL-encoded and JSON formats.
We create a POST route for the /api/form-data endpoint.
Inside the route handler function, we use the debug module to log the form data received from the request body.
We can then perform any necessary actions with the form data, such as saving it to a database.
Finally, we send a JSON response indicating that the form data has been submitted successfully.
In the app.listen() callback function, we use debug to log the server URL.
